			<h3 id="module-title" class="subheader">HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes: Immortality &amp; Cancer</h3>
			<p>
				In 1951, cervical cancer cells from an African-American woman, Henrietta Lacks, being treated in the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore were the first grown outside the human body in a Petri dish. This module analyzes the establishment of the HeLa cell line, the most widely used in biomedical research, highlighting the interplay of biology, race, class, and gender in its creation. The readings span the benefits and risks associated with altruistic human tissue donation or mass banking of clinical samples, the laws and practices currently in place for human subjects research, and the issues surrounding the private and public sector management of payment for these cell sources as well regulation of access to the potential products and knowledge produced from these sources. The resources and activities highlight the basic principles and concepts of cell biology such as cell division, cancer, and the important role that viruses, such as HPV, and proteins, such as telomerase, play in “immortalizing” cells allowing for the establishment human cell lines as biological tools of study. Beyond the biology, the module traces the evolution of laws and guidelines to recast compensation, privacy, and ownership related to human tissues, cells, and DNA within the context of bone marrow donation (Flynn v. Holder), egg procurement (New York and California policies), and genome biobanking (Havusapai v. Arizona State University). The module tackles these questions: What controls cell division in the body and in a dish? What is the relationship, if any, between cancer cells and stem cells? Can we challenge the normative assumptions surrounding biomedical research to support more just and informed participation in shaping healthcare practices and policies? How can communities ensure access to both the process and outcomes of health research to address their specific values, needs, and concerns? Educational materials include: readings and resources, learning activities, timelines, infographics, powerpoints slide sets, discussion questions, and a peer-reviewed case study titled HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes: Immortality &amp; Cancer.
			</p>
			<h4 id="readings-resources" class="subheader">Readings &amp; Resources</h4>
			<p>
				The module provides an interdisciplinary set of resources that are organized by conceptual themes as can be seen in the graphic representation below. We have selected nineteen of these as Essential Resources for HeLa Cells and HPV Genes [downloadable] that include at minimum one brief article and one more indepth article for each of the conceptual themes. If there is only one article to assign, it could be the Weasel article, which provides biological address of cell lines while addressing ethical issues including autonomy and health inequities that reify racial and gender inequities. Additionally, this collection is available in HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes Learning Resources Mapped by Themes Text List [downloadable]. The collection of resources encourages learners to view biomedical research through different lenses that support critical thinking and analysis. A more expansive set of resources is available from the REFWORKS Bibliographic Software and is searchable by keyword, news clips and films and a theatrical performance entitled “They Called Me HeLa” are available from the Media section the Stem Cells Across the Curriculum website, and additional resources are used in the HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes: Immortality &amp; Cancer Case Study and associated Primer.
			</p>
			<h4 id="goals-activities" class="subheader">Learning Goals &amp; Activities</h4>
			<p>
				The activities below explores the biology of cancer cells, cell lines, and genomes and the social context in which they are obtained and used for biomedical research using the 7E Learning Model [hyperlink to http://itsabout-time.com/htmls/ap/eisenkrafttst.pdf. The activities can be used independently of one another or in combination to promote student-centered learning and ethical reasoning that requires understanding multiple points of view. Learning Activity 1 elicits prior knowledge and misconceptions about the establishment of the HeLa cell line, the spread of HeLa cells in tissue culture collections, and the emergence of HeLa Genome Access Working Group. Learning Activity 2 encourages exploration, explanation, and elaboration of multiple points of view in the form of alternative narratives, including film, poetry, mixed media, and theater. Learning Activity 3 is a capstone experience that uses the case study HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes: Immortality &amp; Cancer. This case explores current policies and debates regarding human subjects research and asks students to adopt the view of a particular stakeholder and then apply what they have learned earlier in a course, or through Learning Activities 1 and 2 in shaping policies for the most just way forward. This case is part of a peer-reviewed collection and is flexible for a number of classroom environments and allows instructors to choose the components that best meet the needs of students who are working from a range of disciplinary backgrounds and skill sets. We encourage you to browse through the activities and select the ones that would work best for your course and encourage you to read through the Pedagogies and Philosophies and the Primer associated with this module.

			<h4 id="timelines" class="subheader">Timelines</h4>
			<p>
				A timeline regarding human subjects research and disability justice can be accessed from the <a href="timelines.html">Timelines.</a>
			</p>

			<h4 id="timelines" class="subheader">Infographics</h4>
			<p>
				Because there are many ways to learn and increasing amounts of content to master, infographics allow large amounts of content and data to emerge from the page in ways that help the learner organize and retrieve information as needed. A <a href="sources.html">Sources of Stem Cells Radial Infographic </a> allows students to view the way in which the establishment of the cancerous cell line, HeLa, laid the foundation for IVF, stem cell research, and stem cell therapies to treat cancer.
			</p>
			
			<h4 id="timelines" class="subheader">Powerpoint Slide Sets</h4>
			<p>
				The PowerPoint collection can be customized for specific uses in the classroom and has also been used in a “flipped classroom” format. Many slides contain links to web resources, animations, films, and interactive sites, as well as substantial information for self-directed learning in the "notes" section of each slide. Many slides are intentionally animated to allow for information flow that promotes longterm retention, and some include in-class activity prompts for classroom assessment
			</p>

			<h4 id="timelines" class="subheader">Discussion Questions</h4>
			<p>
				A set of Discussion Questions based on the content and learning goals of this curriculum are included to help learners draw out the most salient principles and concepts associated with the curricular frame. The questions are organized based on the themes used for the Learning Resources and span, cell culture, HPV, compensation, bodily goods, and ethics. [Link the Discussion Questions for HeLa and HPV pdf or you can hyperlink to the phrase in the first sentence “Discussion Questions” in the same way you are doing for the Learning Resources section of this page]
			</p>

			<h4 id="timelines" class="subheader">Primer</h4>
			<p>
				This text-based background primer is organized to address the 1) definitions of “health” and the emergence of biomedical research, 2) basic cell structure, organization, and bioecological niches as they relate to cell division and cancer, 3) the historical trajectory of the first two human cell lines, HeLa and WI-38, and issues of commercialization, dissemination, and commodification, 4) techniques and practices associated with cell culture, cell banking, and cell identification, 5) the relationship among human papilloma virus (HPV), genomic instability, diagnostics, and cancer, and 6) policies and controversies regarding human subjects research and bodily goods. The primer cross-references a PowerPoint slide presentation that animates and organizes the information being presented.
