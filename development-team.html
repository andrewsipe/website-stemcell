					Charnell is a Sociology and Culture Adjunct Professor in the African-American Studies Department at CUNY New York City College of Technology and a working artist and executive director of her own social justice and womanist performance and education consulting firm, Covert Consulting. She graduated with a BA in Literature from Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts with honors. Her participation on the SCAC project grew from her experience as a student registered in the course Stem Cells and Social Justice where she learned of the story of Henrietta Lacks. She proposed a play to bring this and other stories of health inequity to the fore, and received a national fellowship “Developing Leadership in Black Women’s Health Scholarship” to pursue her Master’s of Arts in Women’s Health at Suffolk University graduating in 2010 with honors. Healing is a full-length multi-media and multi-art play based on interviews with Black women directly affected by HIV/AIDS, sickle cell anemia, weight, and chronic illnesses. The play situates their health narratives as exemplars of the current racist and sexist health disparities faced by Black Women living in America beginning with Henrietta Lacks. An excerpt of her full-length play Healing titled “They Called Me HeLa” is posted on our Media page, and she can be contacted about scheduling a performance.

					Chelsea Briganti graduated from Parsons School of Design in 2010 with a BFA in Product Design. Her contribution to the SCAC project includes Mademoicell, a device that collects menstrual stem cells for storage and retrieval, which appears in the Radial Infographic on Sources of Stem Cells and the Adult Blood Detailed Sheet and is highlighted in the HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes: Immortality &amp; Cancer and Eggs &amp; Blood: Gifts &amp; Commodities Modules. Chelsea worked with stem cell researchers, gynecologists, and women to design a device that promotes public banking of menstrual blood stem cells and serves as an alternative to costly private banking. Chelsea is the co-founder of the social innovation think tank called The Way We See The World that has produced a body of work encompassing sustainable toys, biodegradable edible cups, and hydrating superfood for aging populations. Chelsea envisions designers as agents of change and fundamentally believes in the cross-pollination of ideas and resources, as well as the exciting, translational space where design converges with science. Her work is currently featured at the MoMA Design Store, and publications include Wired, TIME Magazine, Wall Street Journal, New York Times Magazine and Fast Company.

					Lianna earned a BA in Interdisciplinary Science and minor in Gender Studies from Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts and received the Interdisciplinary Science Outstanding Senior Award. Her participation on the SCAC project grew from her experience as a student registered in the course Stem Cells and Social Justice. As an upperclassman she contributed to SCAC as an educational consultant by serving as a Science Fellow for the 2011 version of the stem cells course and consolidating the content of this course for the scale-up to a University Lecture course in 2012. Her insight in organizing content, content flow, and design for much of the SCAC project proved essential. She is co-author of Powerpoint Slide Sets, Radial Infographic for Sources of Stem Cells and the associated Detailed Sheets. Her dedication to this project has resulted in continued support long after graduation and her keen eye for hierarchy has been essential for the integration of design for complex biological concepts and principles. She currently volunteers at The Sylvia Rivera Law Project and is exploring post-graduate plans centered on social justice.

					Nona earned a BA in Interdisciplinary Science from Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts and also received the Interdisciplinary Science Outstanding Senior Award. Her participation on the SCAC project grew from her experience as a freshman student registered in the course Stem Cells and Social Justice. As an upperclassman, she contributed to SCAC as an administrative assistant and educational consultant, recording and reflecting on students’ learning during class sessions and Chamany’s teaching. Later coined, “Nona’s Notes”, these observations in the classroom became a primary resource in transforming this course into a university lecture course launched in Spring 2013 and her Senior Research Proposal on Visualization in Science informed the design and content of SCAC infographics and animations. She is pursuing her interest in science communication, and is a studio producer at inVentiv Health Creative Studios overseeing digital and print projects created for healthcare PR firms and a freelance science writer reporting on DIY science and bioart for publications such as PopSci and Scientific American.

					Katie and Ariel served as graduate student teaching assistants for the University Lecture Course Immortality and Immorality: Stem Cells and Social Justice and implemented SCAC materials and provided vital feedback on userability and students learning. In this capacity they recorded student learning outcomes, assisted in the development of review questions and grading rubrics, and provided class notes on student learning and teaching. Their contributions to the scale-up efforts of transforming a course for undergraduate liberal arts students in a seminar format to a university lecture catering to Parsons Design students was instructive and reshaped many of our approaches.

					Astrid earned a BA in Interdisciplinary Science from Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts and also received the Interdisciplinary Science Outstanding Senior Award. Her participation on the SCAC project grew from her experience as a science student repeatedly coming across the story of Henrietta Lacks in numerous courses. Her final papers in many courses were intimately tied to the basic biological concepts associated with the HeLa cell line: telomerase, cell culture and contamination, HPV, and cancer. Sections of these papers were used to build the Primer for the HeLa Cells &amp; HPV Genes: Immortality &amp; Cancer Module and also informed our desire to create Timelines for this curriculum. She is currently in nursing school.
